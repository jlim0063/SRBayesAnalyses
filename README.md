# Bayes Data Analyses



## R Variable Legend





## Notes:


I also ran a few "experimental" models on the side just to see what I'd get out of these. Basically, I wanted to see if LogLLA and LogBaserate had any bearing on reaction time. I was thinking if either source of information is "apparent" enough (e.g. 9/10 odds being highly indicative of left box, compared to say, 2/10), that should reduce reaction time on that given trial. 

Please feel free to tear apart my logic here. The assumption here is that a LogLLA and LogBaserate values toward the ends of their possible ranges would result in a shorter reaction time. Because both LogLLA and LogBaserate encompass a zero-centred range of negative vs positive values, I created 2 variables by taking the absolute values of both (absLogLLA, absLogBaserate).

The pooled model estimates here show absLogBaserate sig. predicts RT, i.e. the closer Odds are to 0 or 10, the faster the reaction time. The separate AM/PM models show this effect is only present in the AM session, and absent in the PM session, which may imply a less reckless(?) consideration of both sources of information when closer to the circadian peak. Bayes-wise, the theoretical implication here would concern the **speed** of decision-making being a function of the strength of the prior, given certain conditions.
